In the Exercises project, look at the code in the state/DirectionService class. This is the class that powers our mapping app for triathletes. 
It provides three methods for calculating the estimated time of arrival (ETA), the direction between two points 
and last method for switching to the next part of the race (e.g. swmming to bicycling) name this method switchPoint.
you need to implement the last method in this task as well. it is not implemented.

Identify the problems in this implementation. 
Then, refactor the code to use the state pattern. 
What are the benefits of the new implementation?
