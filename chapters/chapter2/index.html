					<h4>Part 1: Utility Types</h4>
					<p>TypeScript provides several utility types to facilitate common type transformations. These utilities are available globally.</p>
				</div>
			</section>
				<section>
					Partial Type
					<p>Constructs a type with all properties of Type set to optional. This utility will return a type that represents all subsets of a given type.</p>
				</section>
				<section>Demo</section>
					<section>
					Required Type
					<p>Constructs a type consisting of all properties of Type set to required. The opposite of Partial.</p>
				</section>
				<section>Demo</section>
				<section>
					Readonly Type
					<p>Constructs a type with all properties of Type set to readonly, meaning the properties of the constructed type cannot be reassigned.</p>
					<p>This utility is useful for representing assignment expressions that will fail at runtime (i.e. when attempting to reassign properties of a frozen object).</p>
				</section>
				<section>Demo</section>
				<section>

					<section>
						Record
						<p>Constructs an object type whose property keys are Keys and whose property values are Type. This utility can be used to map the properties of a type to another type.</p>
						<p> the Record type is not identical to the index signature <pre><code class="typescript-language" data-trim data-noescape> [name: string]: number; </code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>we can not use a Union type to describe an index signature key </p>
							<pre><code class="typescript-language" data-trim data-noescape> 
								[name: string | number]: number;
								[name: "key1" | "key2"]: number;
							</code></pre>
							<p>howerver we can do it in Recored Type</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>Demo</section>
				<section>
					Pick
					<p>Constructs a type by picking the set of properties Keys (string literal or union of string literals) from Type.</p>
				</section>
				<section>Demo</section>
				<section>
					Omit
					<p>Constructs a type by picking all properties from Type and then removing Keys (string literal or union of string literals).</p>
				</section>
				<section>Demo</section>

				<section>
					Exclude
					<p>Constructs a type by excluding from UnionType all union members that are assignable to ExcludedMembers.</p>
				</section>
				<section>Demo</section>
				<section>
					Extract
					<p>Constructs a type by extracting from Type all union members that are assignable to Union.</p>
				</section>
				<section>Demo</section>
				<section>
					NonNullable
					<p>Constructs a type by excluding null and undefined from Type.</p>
				</section>
				<section>Demo</section>
				<section>
					Parameters
					<p>Constructs a tuple type from the types used in the parameters of a function type Type.</p>
				</section>
				<section>Demo</section>
				<section>
					ConstructorParameters
					<p>Constructs a tuple or array type from the types of a constructor function type. It produces a tuple type with all the parameter types (or the type never if Type is not a function).</p>
				</section>
					<section>Demo</section>
					<section>
					ReturnType					
					<p>Constructs a type consisting of the return type of function Type.</p>
				</section>
				<section>Demo</section>
				<section>
					InstanceType
					<p>Constructs a type consisting of the instance type of a constructor function in Type.</p>
				</section>
				<section>Demo</section>
				<section>
					ThisParameterType
					<p>Extracts the type of the this parameter for a function type, or unknown if the function type has no this parameter.</p>
				</section>
				<section>Demo</section>

					<h4>Part 2: Creating Types from Types</h4>
					<p>TypeScriptâ€™s type system is very powerful because it allows expressing types in terms of other types.</p>
					<p>we alredy learned about generics, lets dive in into some more conceps</p>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section>
				<ul>
					<li>1. Keyof Type Operator - Using the keyof operator to create new types</li>
					<li>2. Typeof Type Operator - Using the typeof operator to create new types</li>
					<li>3. Indexed Access Types - Using Type['a'] syntax to access a subset of a type</li>
					<li>4. Conditional Types - Types which act like if statements in the type system</li>
					<li>5. Mapped Types - Creating types by mapping each property in an existing type</li>
					<li>6. Template Literal Types - Mapped types which change properties via template literal strings</li>
				</ul>
